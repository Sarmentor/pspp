@command{pspp-convert} is a command-line utility accompanying
@pspp{}. It reads an SPSS or SPSS/PC+ system file or SPSS portable
file or encrypted SPSS syntax file @var{input} and
writes a copy of it to another @var{output} in a different format.
Synopsis:

@display
@t{pspp-convert} [@var{options}] @var{input} @var{output}

@t{pspp-convert -@w{-}help}

@t{pspp-convert -@w{-}version}
@end display

The format of @var{input} is automatically detected, when possible.
The character encoding of old SPSS system files cannot always be
guessed correctly, and SPSS/PC+ system files do not include any
indication of their encoding.  Use @code{-e @var{encoding}} to specify
the encoding in this case.

By default, the intended format for @var{output} is inferred based on its
extension:

@table @code
@item csv
@itemx txt
Comma-separated value.  Each value is formatted according to its
variable's print format.  The first line in the file contains variable
names.

@item sav
@item sys
SPSS system file.

@item por
SPSS portable file.

@item sps
SPSS syntax file.  (Only encrypted syntax files may be converted to
this format.)
@end table

@command{pspp-convert} can convert most input formats to most output
formats.  Encrypted SPSS file formats are exceptions: if the input
file is in an encrypted format, then the output file will be the same
format (decrypted).  To decrypt such a file, specify the encrypted
file as @var{input}.  The output will be the equivalent plaintext
file.  Options for the output format are ignored in this case.

The password for encrypted files can be specified a few different
ways.  If the password is known, use the @option{-p} option
(documented below) or allow @command{pspp-convert} to prompt for it.
If the password is unknown, use the @option{-a} and @option{-l}
options to specify how to search for it, or @option{--password-list}
to specify a file of passwords to try.

Use @code{-O @var{extension}} to override the inferred format or to
specify the format for unrecognized extensions.

The following options are accepted:

@table @option
@item -O @var{format}
@itemx --output-format=@var{format}
Specifies the desired output format.  @var{format} must be one of the
extensions listed above, e.g. @code{-O csv} requests comma-separated
value output.

@item -c @var{maxcases}
@itemx --cases=@var{maxcases}
By default, all cases are copied from @var{input} to @var{output}.
Specifying this option to limit the number of cases written to
@var{output} to @var{maxcases}.

@item -e @var{charset}
@itemx --encoding=@var{charset}
Overrides the encoding in which character strings in @var{input} are
interpreted.  This option is necessary because old SPSS system files,
and SPSS/PC+ system files, do not self-identify their encoding.

@item -p @var{password}
@item --password=@var{password}
Specifies the password to use to decrypt an encrypted SPSS system file
or syntax file.  If this option is not specified,
@command{pspp-convert} will prompt interactively for the password as
necessary.

Be aware that command-line options, including passwords, may be
visible to other users on multiuser systems.

When used with @option{-a} (or @option{--password-alphabet}) and
@option{-l} (or @option{--password-length}), this option specifies the
starting point for the search.  This can be used to restart a search
that was interrupted.

@item -a @var{alphabet}
@item --password-alphabet=@var{alphabet}
Specifies the alphabet of symbols over which to search for an
encrypted file's password.  @var{alphabet} may include individual
characters and ranges delimited by @samp{-}.  For example, @option{-a
a-z} searches lowercase letters, @option{-a A-Z0-9} searches uppercase
letters and digits, and @option{-a ' -~'} searches all printable ASCII
characters.

@item -l @var{max-length}
@item --password-length=@var{max-length}
Specifies the maximum length of the passwords to try.

@item --password-list=@var{file}
Specifies a file to read containing a list of passwords to try, one
per line.  If @var{file} is @file{-}, reads from stdin.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Prints a usage message on stdout and exits.

@item -v
@itemx --version
Prints version information on stdout and exits.
